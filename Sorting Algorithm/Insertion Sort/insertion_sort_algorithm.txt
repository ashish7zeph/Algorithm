//Insertion sort algorithm

	//values to the left of key (A[j]) in every iteration of for loop, are sorted
	//insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards
	//you pick each card i.e. key and place it in its right sorted position
	//you finds out the position as while loop does in the algo
	//card you pick is key
	//left of key is the card with sorted hand
	//right of key is the pile of cards to pick


for j = 2 to A.length
	key = A[j]
	i = j - 1
	while i > 0 and A[i] > key	// loop goes from j-1 to 1 until A[j] > key or until the right postion for key is found
		A[i+1] = A[i]    	//element of array A at position i get shifted to position i+1 or elements gets right shifted
		i = i - 1
	A[i+1] = key		//every key is placed at its right position
