Learn Analysis and Designing of Algorithms from Cormen



## Definition of Algorithm

An Algorithm is any 'well-defined computational procedure' that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some values, or set of values, as output.
or simply we say algorithm is a tool for solving computational problem.

An Algorithm is described as program written in a Pseudocode

Issues of data abstraction, modularity, and error handling are often ignored in order to convey the essence of algorithm concisely.
