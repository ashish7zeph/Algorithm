for finding the Middle element of a Linked List in an optimised way:

	For Rabbit Tortoise we have --
		struct node*head
		struct node*fast_ptr
		struct node*slow_ptr
		i.e, we have 3 pointers..

	For a space optimised way, we can use --
		struct node*head
		struct node*ptr
		int counter
		i.e, we can use 2 pointers and a counter
		for the same job
